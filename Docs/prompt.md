FanFlick – Product Build Prompt
Product Overview

Build a mobile-first application called FanFlick.

FanFlick is a creator-driven social platform where users create and publish short, original or parody trailers (30–180 seconds) and broadcast them to followers. The platform is centered entirely around trailer-style storytelling, not general short videos.

This is not a generic video app. Every design, feature, and interaction must reinforce “this is a trailer”.

No full movie scenes, episodes, or ripped copyrighted footage

Licensed or user-owned audio

Every upload must be labeled as:

4. Engagement System

Engagement must encourage creative dialogue.

No low-effort reactions (e.g. emoji floods).

5. Creator Profiles

Each creator profile functions as a portfolio.

Subscription support for creators

Do not force monetization into the MVP UX.

UX & Design Principles

Mobile-first

Cinematic, minimal, dark-mode friendly

Zero clutter

Over-gamification

Trend chasing visuals

Success Criteria

The product is successful if:

Users understand immediately that this is a trailer platform

Creators feel constrained in a good way

Viewers come to discover ideas, not personalities

Engagement reflects thought and feedback, not noise

Long-Term Vision

FanFlick should evolve into:

A discovery platform for creative talent

A testing ground for story ideas

A fan-driven concept incubator

A bridge between fandom and original IP creation

Final Instruction to Builder

Do not generalize this into a standard social media app.

Build FanFlick as a focused, intentional platform where:

Ideas are pitched through trailers
Creativity is the currency
Storytelling comes first
