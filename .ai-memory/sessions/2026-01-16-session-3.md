# Session: Phase 3 - Feed Experience
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Started**: 02:35

## Objective
Implement Phase 3: Vertical, Full-Screen Cinematic Feed.

## Progress
- [x] Created `FeedItem` component (Video + Overlays).
- [x] Created `FeedList` component (Vertical Pagination).
- [x] Integrate `FeedList` into Home/Feed Screen.
- [x] Fixed missing `expo-linear-gradient` dependency.
- [x] Fixed video layout black bars by using `StyleSheet.absoluteFill`.
- [x] Customized Tab Bar: Removed "Create" label (Icon only).
- [x] Implemented Discovery Logic (Quality > Recency):
    - Updated `Media` schema with `metrics` and content metadata.
    - Added `GET /api/media/feed` with aggregation score `(likes*2 + comments*3)`.
    - Integrated `FeedList.tsx` to fetch API data (with mock fallback).
- [x] Fixed Critical Bug: `GET /feed` 500 Error.
    - Cause: Route ordering. `/:id` was defined before `/feed`, causing "feed" to be treated as an ID.
    - Fix: Moved `/feed` route to the top of `mediaRoutes.ts`.
- [x] Fixed TypeScript Resolution Error.
    - Cause: strict path mapping in `tsconfig.json` missing wildcards, and direct deep import in `FeedList.tsx`.
    - Fix: Added `/*` wildcards to `tsconfig.json` paths and updated `index.ts` in api-client to export all media types. Updated `FeedList.tsx` to import from root `@packages/api-client`.

## Files Changed

- `apps/mobile-expo/components/feed/FeedItem.tsx`
