# Session 3: Push Notifications & Content Reporting
**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Duration**: ~3 hours

## Summary
Implemented push notifications for new trailer alerts and built a content reporting system with admin dashboard foundation. Push notifications notify followers when creators publish trailers. Content reporting allows users to flag inappropriate content with reasons and admin review workflow.

## Completed
- ✅ Push Notifications Feature
  - Backend: expo-server-sdk integration, push token storage, notification triggers
  - Frontend: expo-notifications, permission handling, deep linking
  - Fixed web platform compatibility issues
- ✅ Content Reporting System
  - Backend: Report model, submission/admin endpoints
  - Frontend: ReportModal with reason selection, integrated into feed
  - Added authentication checks
- ✅ Admin Dashboard Planning
  - Initialized Next.js app with TypeScript & Tailwind
  - Created API client and AuthContext
  - Built 6-phase roadmap for full dashboard implementation
