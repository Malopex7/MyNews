# Session: Reading AI Memory & Workflow Fixes
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Started**: 02:22

## Objective
Read project context from AI memory and ensure the memory workflow is correctly followed.

## Progress
- [x] Explored `.ai-memory` directory.
- [x] Read `FanFlick/Docs/roadmap.md` and confirmed project status (Phase 2 complete).
- [x] Verified `read-memory.md` workflow exists.
- [x] Created this session file to maintain memory continuity.

## Files Changed
- Created `.ai-memory/sessions/2026-01-16-session-2.md`

## Notes
- The "Read Memory" workflow requires manual creation of the session file at the start/end of the reading process.
