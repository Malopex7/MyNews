# Session: Camera Interface Implementation & Optimization

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours

## Summary
Initially implemented the Camera Interface with `expo-camera`, but encountered significant web bundling issues (`expo-camera` native module crashes on web) and configuration conflicts (`nativewind/metro` errors). **Decision made to disable the camera feature** for now as a physical device is unavailable for testing. The feature was mocked to preserve the UI entry points. Additionally, fixed `metro.config.js` and `app/index.tsx` to ensure a stable development environment.

## Completed
- ✅ Implemented Camera UI (Screen, Controls, Preview) [Mocked]
- ✅ Implemented `useCamera` hook logic [Mocked]
- ✅ Updated Navigation (Create Tab -> Camera)
- ✅ **Troubleshooting**: Fixed Web/Metro Bundling Errors
  - Uninstalled `expo-camera` (Deferred to physical device phase)
  - Fixed `metro.config.js` (Reverted to standard Expo config)
  - Updated `app/index.tsx` to redirect to `/(auth)/login`

## Key Files Modified
| Area | Files |
|------|-------|
| Mobile State | `apps/mobile-expo/state/cameraStore.ts` |
| Mobile Hooks | `apps/mobile-expo/hooks/useCamera.ts` (Mocked) |
| Mobile Components | `apps/mobile-expo/components/camera/*` (Mocked Screen) |
| Configuration | `apps/mobile-expo/metro.config.js`, `apps/mobile-expo/app/index.tsx` |
| Docs | `Docs/roadmap.md` |

## Next Steps
- **Gallery Import**: Implement video import from device gallery (Phase 2).
- **Trailer Editor**: Begin implementation of the sequence editor.
- **Re-enable Camera**: When physical device available, reinstall `expo-camera` and restore original hook logic.
